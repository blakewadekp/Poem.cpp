2 Good Timber

7 The tree that never had to fight
8 For sun and sky and air and light,
7 But stood out in the open plain
7 And always got its share of rain,
5 Never became a forest king
7 But lived and died a scrubby thing.

7 The man who never had to toil
8 To gain and farm his patch of soil,
7 Who never had to win his share
8 Of sun and sky and light and air,
5 Never became a manly man
7 But lived and died as he began.

7 Good timber does not grow with ease,
8 The more the storm, the more the strength.
8 By sun and cold, by rain and snow,
7 In trees and men good timbers grow.

6 We find the patriarchs of both.
7 And they hold counsel with the stars
6 Whose broken branches show the scars
7 Of many winds and much of strife.
7 This is the common law of life.
