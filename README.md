# Poem.cpp
/*
This C++ program allows the user to choose from four different poems and processes the selected poem by counting the number of words in each line. It reads the poem from an input file, processes each line to count the number of words, and writes the result (word count and line content) to an output file.

The program performs the following tasks:

Prompts the user to select one of four predefined poems.
Opens the corresponding poem file for reading.
Processes each line of the poem, counting the number of words in that line.
Outputs the word count along with the original line content to a new text file.
Handles errors in file opening and outputs error messages if there are issues with the files.
