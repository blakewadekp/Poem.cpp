1 Barter
3 By Sara Teasdale  
5 Life has loveliness to sell,
5 All beautiful and splendid things,
6 Blue waves whitened on a cliff,
6 Soaring fire that sways and sings,
5 And children's faces looking up
5 Holding wonder like a cup.

5 Life has loveliness to sell,
6 Music like a curve of gold,
7 Scent of pine trees in the rain,
7 Eyes that love you, arms that hold,
6 And for your spirit's still delight,
6 Holy thoughts that star the night
