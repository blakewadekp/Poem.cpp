4 The Road Not Taken
3 By Robert Frost

7 Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
7 And sorry I could not travel both
7 And be one traveler, long I stood
9 And looked down one as far as I could
7 To where it bent in the undergrowth;
0 
8 Then took the other, as just as fair,
6 And having perhaps the better claim
7 Because it was grassy and wanted wear,
7 Though as for that the passing there
7 Had worn them really about the same,
0 
6 And both that morning equally lay
7 In leaves no step had trodden black.
8 Oh, I kept the first for another day!
8 Yet knowing how way leads on to way
8 I doubted if I should ever come back.
0 
8 I shall be telling this with a sigh
5 Somewhere ages and ages hence:
8 Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,
7 I took the one less traveled by,
7 And that has made all the difference
